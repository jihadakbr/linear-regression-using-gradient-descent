## Objective

My objective as the CEO of a restaurant franchise is to identify potential cities for opening a new outlet that could yield higher profits for the business using linear regression. By analyzing data on profits and populations from existing restaurants in various cities, as well as data on candidate cities and their populations, I aim to employ linear regression analysis to make informed decisions on expanding the business to locations with the most promising profit potential. This statistical approach will enable me to understand the relationship between population size and profit, allowing me to prioritize cities where the projected profits are likely to be higher based on their population demographics.
